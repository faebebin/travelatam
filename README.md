# travelatam
Visualize my Latinamerica travel adventure 2022

# Using OpenLayers + Vite
Following https://openlayers.org/doc/quickstart.html

# Tools choice
Initial idea: Create a ol-based github page that reads from google photos
  - google photos api requesting photos with metadata as location can only be accessed via Oauth2
Then thinking about using qfield/cloud to add photos directly on qgis project and using qfield.cloud api or running qgis-server somewhere eg. DO
  + Have all data (geo + photos) in qgs. Add all the animation in github website
