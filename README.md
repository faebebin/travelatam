# travelatam

Visualize my Latinamerica travel adventure 2022 and soon your's ;)?

# very [WIP]!

Idea: Animate your travel pictures collection from instagram (hopefully later also more plattforms)


# NEXT
(before other TODO's ;)
Enable Insta API Authentication in site / shortlived token generation via UI?

# Tools

## OpenLayers + Vite

Following https://openlayers.org/doc/quickstart.html

## Consider

* Add Typescript, even more as this is a frontend first app
* Tryout https://rxjs.dev/ for more control and interactions with the animations like play, pause, backwards, forward ... . And solve the problem with promise cancelling.

* Add React or View (latter also for training) for more UI and state
* Add Redux?


# TODO

## Refact:

* rethink naming

## Optimize

* data fetching / image loading during animations
* More pure CSS, eg. image carrousel
* Mechanism to continue after leave site and returning - indexDB?

## Dev:

* Format and git hooks 
* Build locally on docker and use test API serving fixtures (eg python http.server)

## Prod

* Add some backend for API tocken management (try Heroku?)
